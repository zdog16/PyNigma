# PyNigma
This project is an attempt to re-create the encryption and decription functionality of the German Enigma Machine in Python.
Why you ask? Because I thought it would be fun and a good way to practice using Python Classes.
I am attempting to do this without looking at any other Enigma Emulators for reference.
Have fun...
